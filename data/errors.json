    "resolution": "This is a classic! It usually means your system's `PATH` isn't aware of where the new tool was installed. Here are a few things to check:\n\n1.  **Restart Your Terminal:** The simplest solution. Sometimes the shell just needs to be reloaded to pick up changes to your profile.\n2.  **Check Installation Notes:** Did the tool's installer print any messages like `You may need to add /path/to/bin to your PATH`? If so, follow those instructions.\n3.  **Check Your Profile:** Look in your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` file to see if a line was added during installation. If it was, you can manually 'source' that file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or open a new terminal.",

    "resolution": "Since GCP VMs have a private IP, you can't access `localhost` directly from your browser. The best practice for development is to use SSH port forwarding.\n\n1.  **Stop your current SSH session.**\n2.  **Reconnect with a port forwarding flag.** This command forwards the VM's port 3000 to your local machine's port 8080.\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute ssh YOUR_VM_NAME --zone=YOUR_ZONE -- -L 8080:localhost:3000\n```\n\n3.  **Start your web server** on the VM again (`npm run dev`).\n4.  **Access it locally** by going to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.\n\nThis keeps your development secure without exposing your VM's ports to the public internet.",

    "errorMessage": "My application stops running as soon as I close the SSH terminal.",
    "resolution": "This happens because the process is tied to your terminal session. To keep it running forever, you need a process manager.\n\nI highly recommend `pm2`. It's a simple and powerful tool for managing Node.js applications.\n\n**1. Install PM2:**\n```bash\nsudo npm install pm2 -g\n```\n\n**2. Start Your App with PM2:**\nInstead of `npm start`, use `pm2` to run your start script. This gives it a name and runs it in the background.\n```bash\npm2 start npm --name your-app-name -- start\n```\n\n**3. Check Status:**\nYou can see logs, status, and more with these commands:\n```bash\npm2 status\npm2 logs your-app-name\n```\nYour app will now automatically restart if it crashes and will continue running after you disconnect.",

    "errorMessage": "I've set up Nginx as a reverse proxy, but I'm seeing a '502 Bad Gateway' error.",
    "resolution": "A 502 error almost always means one thing: Nginx is working, but it can't communicate with the application it's supposed to be proxying traffic to (e.g., your Node.js app running on port 3000).\n\nHere’s how to troubleshoot it:\n\n1.  **Is Your Application Actually Running?** Use `pm2 status` to make sure your application is online and hasn't crashed.\n2.  **Are You on the Right Port?** Double-check your Nginx config file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site`). The `proxy_pass` directive should point to the exact port your app is running on (e.g., `proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;`).\n3.  **Firewall Rules:** Could a firewall be blocking Nginx from talking to your app? While less common for `localhost` traffic, ensure your VM's firewall rules aren't blocking the application's port.",
